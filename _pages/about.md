I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, under the supervision of [Professor Edwin Kan](https://kan.ece.cornell.edu/). My research focused on Radio-Frequency (RF) sensor systems for [indoor people tracking](https://psharma15.github.io/CLEAR/) and [cardiopulmonary monitoring](https://psharma15.github.io/RF-Vital-Sensing/), presented in my thesis on [Radio Freqeuncy sensor applications for assisted living](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/items/d4c14ad8-fdbd-4f0d-8228-27502e579a1e). The research encompassed RF systems, biomedical sensors, signal processing and algorithms, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human subject data collection.

After my PhD, I worked at Biofourmis, a Boston-based healthcare startup that provides remote patient monitoring (RPM) using noninvasive vital sensor-based alerts with real-time clinician support. I used signal processing to develop respiratory biomarkers including improving the RR estimation algorithm using PPG and IMU sensors (**US Patent submitted in October 2023**). I also used deep-learning to develop sleep apnea detection and severity estimation algorithms using SpO2 and PR signals (IEEE EMBC 2022). In addition to research projects, I supported the core RPM platform. This involved tracking vital alert algorithm performance based on alert counts, sensitivity, and specificity estimations, with clinical notes as ground truth. Further, I performed case studies and responded to escalations due to missed alerts or false alerts, as well as contributed to false SpO2 alert reduction due to noisy and corrupted signal.

*I'm currently looking for opportunities in the areas of digital healthcare including wearable sensors, and signal processing and ML.*
