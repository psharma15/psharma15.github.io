I am a multi-disciplinary researcher focused on advancing **digital healthcare** leveraging signal processing, deep learning, wearable sensing, and emerging technologies with 8 years of PhD and industry experience. 

**Academic Focus**: 
My PhD research at Cornell University, under the supervision of [Professor Edwin Kan](https://kan.ece.cornell.edu/), focused on developing novel radio frequency (RF) sensor systems for assisted living applications, detailed in my thesis on [Radio Frequency sensor applications for assisted living](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/items/d4c14ad8-fdbd-4f0d-8228-27502e579a1e). I combined expertise in RF systems, signal processing, machine learning, and biomedical sensors, to create innovative solutions for:
1. Continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring (Funding: NIH, DoD CDMRP) [Link](https://psharma15.github.io/RF-Vital-Sensing/)
  - Developed *wearable near‑field RF sensor prototype* for abnormal respiration monitoring & *signal processing* algorithms for respiratory biomarkers detection in 2-40 BrPM range.
  - Designed and performed an IRB approved *human study* involving simulation of *breathing disorders, apnea, and user attention*. 
  - Collaborated with *Cornell Weill Medical Sleep Center* to collect patient data for sleep apnea detection.
    
2. Assisted living based occupant counting & location estimation (Funding: DoE ARPA‑E)) [Link](https://psharma15.github.io/CLEAR/)
  - Performed *indoor un‑tagged occupant counting* using ML for occupants in different postures.
  - Developed algorithm for *high-resolution 3D occupant image reconstruction* for location estimation.
  - Developed a 1/6 scale prototype to show *real-time demo* in *ARPA-E summit* 2019.


**Industry Experience**: 
After my PhD, I developed innovative remote patient monitoring (RPM) solutions at Biofourmis, a Boston-based healthcare startup. Leveraging my expertise in signal processing and deep learning, I:
* Improved the accuracy of respiratory rate estimation using PPG and IMU sensors, resulting in a *US Patent* submission in October 2023.
* Developed DL-based sleep apnea detection and severity estimation algorithms using SpO2 and PR signals, presented at *IEEE EMBC 2022*, offering a non-invasive and at-home approach for diagnosis and continuous apnea monitoring.
* Contributed to the core RPM platform by tracking vital alert performance, performing case studies, and responding to escalations, ultimately leading to a reduction in false SpO2 alerts due to noisy signals.

**Research Interests: Digital healthcare, Noninvasive physiological monitoring, Wearable sensing, Signal processing, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence, Biomedical engineering **
