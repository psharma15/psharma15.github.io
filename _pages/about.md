My PhD research at Cornell University, under the supervision of [Professor Edwin Kan](https://kan.ece.cornell.edu/), focused on developing novel RF sensor systems for assisted living applications. I combined expertise in RF systems, signal processing, machine learning, and biomedical sensors, to create innovative solutions for [indoor people tracking](https://psharma15.github.io/CLEAR/) and [cardiopulmonary monitoring]([link](https://psharma15.github.io/RF-Vital-Sensing/)), detailed in my thesis on [Radio Frequency sensor applications for assisted living](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/items/d4c14ad8-fdbd-4f0d-8228-27502e579a1e).

After my PhD, I played a key role in developing innovative remote patient monitoring solutions at Biofourmis, a Boston-based healthcare startup. Leveraging my expertise in signal processing and deep learning, I:
* Improved the accuracy of respiratory rate estimation using PPG and IMU sensors, resulting in a US Patent submission in October 2023.
* Developed DL-based sleep apnea detection and severity estimation algorithms using SpO2 and PR signals, presented at IEEE EMBC 2022, offering a non-invasive and at-home approach for diagnosis and continuous apnea monitoring.
* Contributed to the core RPM platform by tracking vital alert performance, performing case studies, and responding to escalations, ultimately leading to a reduction in false SpO2 alerts due to noisy signals.

*I'm currently looking for opportunities in the areas of digital healthcare including wearable sensors, and signal processing and ML.*
