I'm a fifth year PhD student at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Edwin Kan](https://kan.ece.cornell.edu/). My current research projects are on Radio Frequency (RF) sensor systems for [indoor people tracking](https://psharma15.github.io/CLEAR/) and [cardiopulmonary monitoring](https://psharma15.github.io/RF-Vital-Sensing/), focusing on RF system design, signal processing and inverse problems. 

*I'm currently looking for job opportunities.*
