I'm a fifth year Phd Student at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Edwin Kan](https://kan.ece.cornell.edu/). My current research projects are on RF sensor systems for indoor people tracking and cardiopulmonary monitoring, focusing on RF system design and signal processing. *I'm currently looking for work opportunities in the field of data analysis, algorithm development, biomedical electronics and wireless system applications.*
