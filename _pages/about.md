I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, under the supervision of [Professor Edwin Kan](https://kan.ece.cornell.edu/). My research focused on Radio-Frequency (RF) sensor systems for [indoor people tracking](https://psharma15.github.io/CLEAR/) and [cardiopulmonary monitoring](https://psharma15.github.io/RF-Vital-Sensing/), encompassing RF systems, biomedical sensors, signal processing and algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

After my PhD, I worked at Biofourmis, a Boston-based company that provides intelligent remote patient monitoring (RPM). I used signal processing to develop respiratory biomarkers including improving the RR estimation algorithm using PPG and IMU sensors (**US Patent submitted in October 2023**). I also used deep-learning to develop sleep apnea detection and severity estimation algorithms using SpO2 and PR signals. In addition to research projects, I improved false SpO2 alert rejection, generated vital alert trend visualizations, and derived alert performance factors to support the core RPM platform.

*I'm currently looking for job opportunities.*
