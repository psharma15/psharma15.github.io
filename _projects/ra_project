title: "Wearables + AI + Autoimmune Disease"
excerpt: "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) flares are unpredictable and often detected only after symptom escalation, delaying treatment adjustments and increasing the risk of joint damage. There is a critical need for continuous, objective monitoring tools that can identify early physiologic signals of disease worsening."

**Problem**
Although wearable devices generate continuous physiological data, their integration into specialty care workflows remains limited. Demonstrating clinical utility in complex diseases such as RA is essential for broader adoption.

**Approach**
Working within a clinical rheumatology setting, I evaluate how multimodal wearable-derived features can augment traditional clinical assessments. This includes studying associations between physiologic metrics, patient-reported symptoms, and inflammatory markers, and developing AI frameworks for flare prediction. 
Our findings are published in [Wearable devices detect physiological changes that precede and are associated with symptomatic and inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis flares](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-29748-y)

**Impact**
By bridging consumer-grade sensing technologies with specialty clinical care, this work lays the foundation for scalable remote monitoring programs in autoimmune disease management.
