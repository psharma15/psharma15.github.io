This project implemented arc classification algorithm, and optimal arc sensor placement algorithm in a grid.

  * Developed an algorithm for low-voltage (230 V, 50 Hz) arc characterization and classification from other spikes using k-means clustering of PSD spectral distance measurements, achieving high accuracy > 96%.
  * Developed an algorithm to estimate optimal sensor number and location for arc detection using bipartite graph approach with high accuracy, which achieved cost reduction by 24.75% in smaller electrical networks.
