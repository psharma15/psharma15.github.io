This project implements novel high resolution Radio-Frequency (RF) imaging in indoor environment to monitor untagged people or objects.

  * Developed approximation techniques to tackle constrained-resource issues with large training data and limited CPU, memory and energy
availability, specifically in mobile devices.
  * Studied accuracy vs resource trade-off with different approximation techniques at both training and inference in machine learning algorithms
including regression, neural networks and SVM.
