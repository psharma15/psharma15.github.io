This project implements novel high resolution Radio-Frequency (RF) imaging in indoor environment to monitor untagged people or objects.

  * Implemented novel sparsity-based OMP and FISTA reconstruction algorithms for high resolution RF imaging, using untagged-object backscattered phase from ambient low-cost passive UHF RFID tags.
  * Developed simulation study in CST Microwave Studio to compare relative tag-receiver placement and algorithm performance.
  * Designed a noise-canceling calibration algorithm to mitigate backscattered phase offsets from direct tag-to-receiver LOS, background object multipath, and receiver cables and circuits introduced phase for improved size and location estimation.
  * Developed ensemble algorithms to improve the performance and reduce parameter sensitivity for inverse methods with limited bandwidth and spatial diversity.
  * Implemented convex optimization and level-set approaches to extract object shape and size from the pixel reflectivity of imaging domain.
  * Developed an optimal frequency selection algorithm for a broad bandwidth, multi-frequency setup to generate improved Fourier-reconstructed image based on improved sampling in the K-space.
  * Tested super-resolution imaging based Capon and maximum entropy algorithms, which provided improved performance over matched-filtering for shape estimation with increased computational and time complexity.
